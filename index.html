        <p class="Introduction">
            I have 10 years of experience in an administrative position with a technical overlap - SW testing and communication with developers. 
            I speak English and Spanish fluently. After parental leave, I threw myself into retraining. I graduated from the Czechitas Digital Academy
            focused on testing. I am customer-oriented and careful. I am very interested in the field of testing and I enjoy it. It is the direction
            I want to pursue professionally.
